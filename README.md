# Keep Presence

This program moves the mouse or press a key when it detects that you are away.  
It won't do anything if you are using your computer.  
Useful to trick your machine to think you are still working with it.
It can be used to avoid going idle on messaging apps like Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc.
